Arrays In Java:
    Arrays allow us to store multiple values in single variable.
    We use indexes to get back the values.
Why we should learn Arrays:
    If we have to store a lot of values. It becomes very hard to manage a
    lof of variables
Syntax of Arrays:
    WE can create arrays in two different ways.

First way
    Datatype[] arr={element1,element2,element3,....};
    System.out.println(arr[0])

Second way
    DataType[] arr=new DataType[size]
