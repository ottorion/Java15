when we should use String class:
    when we want to save as much memory as possible and we are okay if
    the programs get a little slow
when should we use stringBuilder class:
    when we want maximum speed and we don't care how much memory out
    programs going to occupy.
What does it mean by String is immutable:
    It means Strings are not rechangeable once created in the memory
    of the computer, and the reason they are immutable is that same memory
    cell can be shared
