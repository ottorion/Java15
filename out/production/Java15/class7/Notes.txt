While Loop:
    They help us repeat code.

Why should we use whileloops:
    Because manually copying and pasting is very bad, and it is
    not scalable. They also help us reduce the number of lines of code that we have to type

Syntax Whileloop:
    while (condition){
    code that we want to repeat
    }
