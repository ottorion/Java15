Methods in Java
    it is just collection of java statements and blocks of code like
    if else loop printlns etc.

Why should we learn about methods:

    1)it allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic
    into smaller parts by creating methods for them build those methods
    are one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application
    2)Methods allow us to re-use code.
    3)Methods allows us to be flexible.

How can we create Methods?
    There are two types built-in and user defined.

Built-in methods?
    The methods which are designed by JAva developers for example println()
    nextInt() method in the scanner class length() present String class they
    are all built-in methods.

User Defined methods
    the methods that we write.
MEthods which return something when called and otherss are methods
which do not return anything when called

int add(int a, int b){
return a+b;
}
int =>return type of method
add => name of the method
(int a, int b)=> parameters of the method or the input to the methods
{=>body of the method
}
