Operators:
                Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition,
        subtractions we can compare things if two entities are sane or not if a number is greater
        than the other number or not. There are three main types operators. They are Arithmetic
        operators, Relational operators and logical operators.

Arithnetic operators:
                We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like additions,
        subtraction.
        + => Addition
        - => Subtraction
        / => Division
        * => Multiplication
        % => Modulus, remainder

Relational operators:
                Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. for example
        if something bigger than other thing or if two numbers are same or not
        == => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true
        otherwise we get false
        != => used to check if two variables don't contain the same value, we get a true if
        they are not same
        > => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we get a
        true
        < => used to check if the value of the left is smaller than th value of the right side
        we will get a true
        >= => if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right side or if they
        are same we will get a true
        <= => it is opposite of >=
Conditional constructs
                Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute basd on a condition is
        true that java execute the code otherwise it skips that code.
        How to write ifelse conditions:
        If(condition) {
        any line of code even another if condition
        }
        if(){
        }
        }
