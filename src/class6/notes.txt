Logical Operators:
    Logical operators allows us to combine multiple conditions.they only work with boolean(true,false) values.
    there are three logical operators
    1- !, ||, &&

qhy should we use logical operators:
    1) they can greatly simplfy the logic
    2) it helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write.

NOT(!):
    it reverses the conditions. if something is true it will make it false and if something is false it will make it true.
    System.out.println(!true)=false

Logical or Operator (||):
    it can combine two or more conditions and returns true as long as there is
    one condition true.if all the conditions false it becomes a false
